            <p>
                &nbsp;<b>Tofu Stir Fry </b>dishes are awesome because they are easy to cook and only takes a little
                time
                to
                complete.
                Almost any
                vegetable or meat can be stir-fried using different techniques. What we have here is a simple vegetable
                stir-fry
                with
                tofu. This dish contains a good amount of nutrients from the vegetables and protein from the tofu.

            <ol>
                <li>Trim about 2 inches from the kangkong stalks and discard. Cut kangkong into 3-inch lengths,
                    separating the
                    sturdier stalks from the leaves. Wash thoroughly and drain well</li>
                <li>Drain tofu from packing liquid. Pat dry with paper towels to absorb moisture. Cut into 1/2- inch
                    cubes</li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine oyster sauce, chili garlic sauce, water, sesame oil and cornstarch. Stir until
                    well-blended and set aside</li>
                <li>In a wide skillet over medium heat, heat oil until very hot. Add tofu and spread into a single
                    layer. When
                    starting to crisp, turn and continue to cook until lightly browned. Remove from pan, drain excess
                    oil on
                    paper towels and keep warm</li>
                <li>In the pan, add onions and cook until limp. Increase heat to high. Add oyster sauce mixture and cook
                    for
                    about 1 minute or until bubbly and begins to thicken. Add tofu and sturdier stalks of kangkong and
                    cook,
                    stirring regularly, for about 1 minute. Add kangkong leaves and cook, stirring regularly, for
                    another 1 to 2
                    minute or until tofu is heated through and vegetable is tender yet crisp. Season with salt and
                    pepper to
                    taste and serve hot</li>
